# Decision Tree-Based Iris Flower Classification
During my tenure as a Data and Business Analyst Intern at The Sparks Foundation, I undertook a project focused on Decision Tree-Based Iris Flower Classification. Leveraging the Decision Tree algorithm, I successfully crafted a robust classification model capable of categorizing iris flowers with an impressive accuracy rate of 96%. This project involved working with the well-known Iris dataset and showcased my ability to employ machine learning techniques for accurate predictions. The model's effectiveness in classifying iris flowers based on their attributes demonstrates my proficiency in data analysis and business intelligence, highlighting the valuable skills I gained during my internship.
